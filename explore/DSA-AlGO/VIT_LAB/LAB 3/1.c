/*  1.
    Waiting line simulation in a post office:
    In a post office, a lone postal worker serves a single queue of
    customers. Every customer receives a token # (serial number) as
            soon as he/she enters the queue. After the service, the token is
            returned to the postal worker and the customer leaves the queue. At
            any point of time the worker may want to know how many
            customers are yet to be served.
    Write C code to implement the system using an appropriate queue
            data structure, simulating an arrival and departure of customers
            after service completion
