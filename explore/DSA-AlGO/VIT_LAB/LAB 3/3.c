/*  3.
    A group of players, sitting around as a circle, are playing the “Pass
    the Buck” game where a small parcel/handkerchief is passed
    around from one person to another until the music stops. The
    player with whom the buck stops has to quit the game, and the
    game continues without that player in the same way. The player
    who has not yet been removed is considered as the winner.
    Simulate this game using circular queues.
