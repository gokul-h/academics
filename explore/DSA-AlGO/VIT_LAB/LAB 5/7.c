/*  7.
    Let A and B be arrays of n integers each.
    A common subsequence of A and B is a sequence(not necessarily contiguous)
    of integers of A that also belongs to B. For example,
    if the entries of A are 5, 8, 6, 4, 7, 1, 3 and the entries of B are 4, 5, 6, 9, 7, 3, 2,
    a common subsequence is 5, 6, 7. Write an algorithm to find a common subsequence of A and B.
    Compute the running time of your algorithm.
