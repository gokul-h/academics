/*  12.
    Let L be a linked list and k be a positive integer.
    Write an algorithm to split L at the position k such that elements appearing
    before k(including k) are all odd numbers and elements appearing after k(excluding k)
    are all even numbers. If the count of even numbers out-number the count of odd numbers,
    append the remaining even numbers at the end of the list.
    Implement the code for both Single and Doubly linked lists
