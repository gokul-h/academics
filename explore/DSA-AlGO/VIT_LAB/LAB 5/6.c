/*  6.
    Write a C Program, which reads ‘n’ numbers and computes the sum of all the
    predecessors of every even number that occurs among the given n numbers.
    The Predecessor of a number is the number that occurs before that number.
    For example, if n=7 and the given numbers are 17, 11, 24, 13, 7, 8, 14 then the answer is (11+7+8=26) .
