/*  5.
    Let L be a linked list and k be a positive integer.
    Write a C Program to split L at the position k such that elements appearing before k(including k)
    are all even numbers and elements appearing after k(excluding k) are all odd numbers.
    If the count of even numbers out-number the count of odd numbers,
    append the remaining even numbers at the end of the list.
    Implement the code for both Single and Doubly linked lists
