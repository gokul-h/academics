/*  4.
    Let L1 and L2 be two linked lists with ‘n’ elements each. Let k be a positive integer,
    with k<n. Write a C Program that will re-direct the pointers at the kth position
    such that the elements coming after the kth position in L1 and L2, now belong to L2 and L1 respectively.
    You should not exchange the data elements, but only write the necessary pseudo-code to alter the pointers.
    For eg. If L1: 1 2 3 4 5 and L2: 6 7 8 9 10 and k=3, then the new contents of L1 and L2 are,
    L1:1 2 3 9 10 and L2: 6 7 8 4 5. Implement the code for both Single and Doubly linked lists
