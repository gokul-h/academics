/*  14.
    Let A be a given string.
    A palindrome is a string when it reads the same backward as forward.
    A substring is a palindrome if a contiguous sequence of characters within the string is a palindrome.
    Write an algorithm that will identify a sub-string of A that is a palindrome.
    Derive the time complexity of your algorithm.
