/*  8.
    Let S be a stack with n positive integers.
    Write an algorithm to create two new stacks S1 and S2 such that all even numbers
    of S are added into S1 and all odd numbers of S are added into S2.
    Illustrate your algorithm for any sample input and output the
    total number of push( ) and pop( ) operations that are performed in the algorithm.
