/*  13.
    Write an algorithm, which reads ‘n’ numbers and computes
    the sum of all the successors of every odd numbers that occur among the given n numbers.
    Successor of a number is the number that occurs after that number in the array.
    For example, if n=7 and the given numbers are 17, 11, 24, 13, 7, 8, 14 then answer is (11+24+7+8=50 )
