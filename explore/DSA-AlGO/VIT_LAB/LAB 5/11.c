/*  11.
    Let L1 and L2 be two linked lists with ‘n’ elements each. D
    efine a condition C as follows: Merge both the lists at a node k to form
    a single common node if the kth node of both L1 and L2 contain the same element.
    Do this for all nodes in both the lists if the condition C is satisfied. I
    mplement the code for both Single and Doubly linked lists
    Note: Define the linked list accordingly so as to validate the necessary conditions.
    For e.g. if L1: 1 2 3 4 5 and L2: 3 2 6 4 8 Then the merged linked list would look like,
