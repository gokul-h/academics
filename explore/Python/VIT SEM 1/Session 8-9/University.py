"""
An university is setting up a new lab at their premises.
Design an algorithm and write Python code to determine the approximate
cost to be spent for setting up the lab. Cost for setting the lab is sum
of cost of computers, cost of furnitures and labour cost.
Use the following formulae for solving the problem:

Cost of computer = cost of one computer * number of computers

Cost of furniture = Number of tables * cost of one table + number of chairs
                                        * cost of one chair

Labour cost = number of hours worked * wages per hour
