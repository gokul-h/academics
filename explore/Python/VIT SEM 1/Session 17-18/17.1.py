"""
A hospital has received a set of lab reports.
Totally five tests are conducted in the lab and the report is prepared.
The report consist of name of the test and the value observed for that
particular patient. Given the details of a test made for a patient,
write an algorithm and the subsequent Python program to print if
the test result is normal or not normal by referring the values
in Table 1. Since the value is sensitive, provide a mechanism
so that the values do not get altered.
